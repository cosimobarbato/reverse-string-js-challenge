JavaScript Code Challenge to Reverse String:
Have the function FirstReverse(str) take the str parameter being passed and return the string in reversed order. For example: if the input string is "Hello World and Coders" then your program should return the string "sredoC dna dlroW olleH".<br>
- I took this a step further by inserting the initial and reverse string to show in the DOM.
